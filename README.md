# pechanga-waiver-app

<br>

**About:**

- This project was an interview project given by the Software Development team at Pechanga Resort Casino to verify my skills as a Software/Web Developer. The project features three waiver forms to be used by different areas of the Resort and Casino that submit to an in-house API. All of the data sent to that API is then displayed on another page for a user to view and interact with the data submitted by the forms. The buttons above will take you to these waivers (Spa Waiver, Golf Waiver, Casino Waiver) and also to the list of submitted waivers (Submissions). I built this project using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS which are both wonderful frameworks to build with (although I am not dependent on).
